# Notes: post-grant plan and revisions

### See "Reinstein key concerns" in discussion doc [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ojb3a2X12av3c97wezYD6zLRkdo1xlx5r21cblf11JY/edit?usp=sharing)

### Administrative concerns (and possible amendments)

Rethink Priorities will act as Fiscal Sponsor for this, to help administer payments. They will also receive $5000 to cover roughly 2 hours/week of [david reinstein](https://app.gitbook.com/u/WrM9GjKWCyRyoIjCKt7f0ddJwCr1 "mention")'s time on this project.

**Administering payments to referees, researchers, etc**

We will need to making small payments to (say) 20-50 different referees, 5-10 committee members and 'editorial managers', 5-10 research prize winners, as well as clerical and IT assistants.

### Spreading the word, 'press release' (WIP)

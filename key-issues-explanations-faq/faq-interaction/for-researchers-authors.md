# For researchers/authors

## General process and requests

### Our current proposed model of the review process (for an established researcher)

We will look for (and pay) two reviewers with research interests in your area, and with complementary expertise. You would be allowed to suggest particular areas you are interested in receiving feedback and suggestions. The reviewers would write detailed and helpful evaluations, and post these anonymously on [kotahi](https://kotahi.community). We will also ask the referees to give some forms of quantitative 'rating' feedback, perhaps rating it in a few metrics, and making a prediction about what tier and type of traditional journal this would likely be published in. All of these reviews and ratings would be made public (for ECRs we may make some exceptions), but you will have the right to respond before or after these are posted. There will be a range of benefits for authors, which can be found below.

We will only need a link to a DOI'd version of your work (also asking for other relevant links). We will not 'publish' your paper, and your paper being handled by the Unjournal would not limit you in any way; you could submit it to any journal before, during, or after the process.

### What we **might ask you as an author to do, allow, and engage with**

If we consider your work for public evaluation in our pilot stage, we might consider asking things like those below, but these are not all necessary, and we will aim to make this very _light touch_ for authors.

1. A link to a non-paywalled, hosted version of your work (which could be in any format - pdfs are not necessary, see [“Benefits of dynamic documents"](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/benefits-and-features/benefits-of-dynamic-documents)), which could be given a DOI. Note that _we_ will not be "publishing" this work, just evaluating it.
2. Asking you for a link to data and code, if possible. and working to help you to make it accessible.
   1. Note our project is not _principally_ about replication, and we are unlikely to be able to do this systematically in our pilot stage. But we want to encourage this accessibility (and we are keen to work with [I4rep](https://i4replication.org/people.html) and others on this in future.)
3. Assigning two evaluators ('referees') who will be paid to assess your work; we will probably keep their identities confidential (although this is a continued discussion point), but we may try to facilitate a confidential channel to enable a dialogue with the authors. We will also have one person on our managing team to handle this process.
   1. Through this process, we may encourage you to continue to update your work in communication with the evaluators, as sort of 'dynamic R\&R'.
4. Asking the evaluators to _publicly_ post their reviews of your work on kotahi, in a special curated section for the Unjournal. We will ask them to provide both feedback, thoughts, and suggestions and some quantitative ratings for the paper, along certain margins.
   1. Getting your permission for this up front.
   2. Allowing you the 'right to respond' before any of this is posted publicly.

## **Why would researchers and groups want to ‘submit their work’ and engage with Unjournal?**

I think the biggest personal gains for authors engaging are:

1. Substantive feedback (which is often very hard to get, especially for young scholars) will help you improve your work (both the work being reviewed and future work)
2. Markers of credibility for your work that could help your career advancement at least at the margin, … and hopefully in the future help a great deal (with retrograde rewards for early adopters, perhaps)
3. Visibility and a connection to the EA/Global Priorities communities, as well as the Open Science movement. This may lead to grant opportunities, open up new ambitious projects, and attract strong PhD students to your research groups
4. Gaining reputation as an ‘early adopter and innovator’ in open science
5. You may win a “best project prize” which could be financial as well as reputational
6. Getting ‘into our system’ will make you more visible to be hired as a paid reviewer or editorial manager
7. We will encourage media coverage, including ‘forwarding’ some work to the Asterisk journal for future coverage (with compensation to those doing the writing)

## **Is it ‘risky’ to make your work public, and to have it reviewed in the Unjournal?**

There are risks and rewards to any activity, of course, and we cannot predict the consequence of any action. We consider some ‘risks’ you may weigh against the benefits mentioned above.

1. “Exclusivity”
2. Public negative/neutral feedback
3. Backlash against innovation or ‘seeming weird’?
4. Could the review process have a downward bias?

### **Exclusivity**

Some traditional journals might have restrictions on the public sharing of your work, and perhaps they might enforce these more strongly if they fear competition from the Unjournal? (We think this is largely not a factor, discussed below)

* The Unjournal is _not exclusive_. Having your paper reviewed and evaluated in the Unjournal will not limit your options; you can still submit your work to traditional journals.
  * At least _we_ are not making any exclusivity restrictions. Some journals might discourage you from publicly posting your work (a ‘pre-print’) but my impression is that this restriction is becoming less and less common or defensible. In Economics, for example, it seems to not be a thing.
* Following a traditional publishing route can also be risky: the world may change, and you may be seen as retrograde. More importantly, publishing (especially in Economics) is slow and has highly variable outcomes. You typically wait months for a response, sometimes over a year, may go through many cycles of reject/revise and resubmit, and may ultimately end up with an outcome (rejection) that has zero value on your CV. With the Unjournal your work always will be given feedback, an evaluation, and a public rating (if you choose). And you can continue to improve your work for future evaluation.

### **Public negative/neutral feedback**

Our plan is to make reviews, feedback and evaluations public. While there has been some movement towards open review underway, this is still not the standard mode. Typically when you submit your paper and it gets rejected you and your co-authors, and the editor and the people who wrote the reviews are the only people who actually know/see this.

With the Unjournal you might get feedback and evaluation that is not always positive, and this may be made public. Is this an unacceptable risk? I don't think so. I think most academics expect that there will be a lot of differing opinions about each piece of work, and everyone will have gotten negative reviews throughout their career.

Suppose instead, you go the standard route and put out a working paper, and submit your paper to a sequence of journals. Suppose you present it at many seminars and finally get it published, let's say 3 years later (not uncommon in Economics), in a middle-status field journal. Will people think that your paper was perfect and not criticized at all? Of course not. If it had been the perfect paper it would have been immediately accepted at the ‘top journal’ perhaps. And people in your field will have been the reviewers and have been at seminars and heard all the critiques of the paper.

Thus, ‘getting public mixed and negative feedback’ in the Unjournal (or anywhere) should not particularly harm you or your research project.

And there are certainly some benefits to having it in the Unjournal. First of all, your willingness to engage with this shows that you have confidence in your work and are willing to back it in public. Secondly, the Unjournal will give authors a place to publicly respond to the critiques, and to improve your work and show how it has improved. Through the internal you may also have a chance for a second evaluation of the same project after iterations and improvements. These are all major advantages over the traditional journal route, where you essentially start over with each new submission and new referees may overlook the same point and have the same misunderstandings each time.

_Nonetheless, a consideration:_ We may want to have a policy of _not publicly revealing_ negative reviews and evaluations of work by early-career authors.

### **Backlash against innovation or ‘seeming weird’**

As the process is slightly unusual or The Unjournal is not such a weird concept: we are providing evaluation and feedback on research, largely with standard metrics, and simply not tying it to journals.

### **Could the review process have a downward bias?**

A potential concern raised is that there's a limited number of positive reviews because, if nothing else, papers are evaluated in part compared. This may create tension. On top of this, if papers improve over time with referee feedback (whether at the Unjournal or elsewhere), the evaluation of where they might "place" would be biased downwards, which could hurt their actual chances of publication in a good journal.

The reason that we consider this unlikely is that there are 'rational expectations' here and that 'unbiased informational signals won't lead to updates systematically in one direction'. In other words, people will take this into account. If a reviewer is reviewing a paper without much information on how others rate it, they might suspect that there have been some substantial and important criticisms, and that the paper has flaws, particularly if it's been around a while, they are submitting to a second tier journal, etc. On the other hand, if I see that the author has submitted it to a transparent assessment service like the Unjournal, particularly if the author has submitted a lot of his or her work to this sort of public scrutiny, I will update positively, all else equal. The author has demonstrated that they are not afraid of public feedback and openness. I will consider the public critiques, of course, but I will take into account that this paper has been held up to more scrutiny than others I might have seen.

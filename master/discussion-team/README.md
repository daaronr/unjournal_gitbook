# Discussion, team

See  [List of People consulted](../../grants-and-proposals/acx-ltff-grant-proposal-as-submitted-successfull/#list-of-people-consulted) (in ACX grant proposal)

### New 'action plan discussion space'&#x20;

Got the grant! – based on the application content [#acx-unjournal-app](../../grants-and-proposals/acx-ltff-grant-proposal-as-submitted-successfull/#acx-unjournal-app "mention") (link to collab space). Now to make something happen! I’ll be fleshing out plan described in that application soon. (Next steps: getting feedback, building a founding committee, setting a concrete agenda of issues to resolve, soliciting interest…)

We’ve had fruitful discussions in the previous essay and discussion Gdoc “[Slaying the journals](../writings/#slaying-the-journals-google-doc-aimed-at-ea-gp-academic-and-open-science-audiences-link)”...&#x20;

I’m starting [this new Gdoc space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ojb3a2X12av3c97wezYD6zLRkdo1xlx5r21cblf11JY/edit?usp=sharing) (embedded at bottom) to enable easy discussion and suggestions. (I had previously suggested the Gitbook for that, but Gdoc seems the best lingua franca). I’ll try to incorporate the discussion here into the gitbook (with attribution) …

### Building team, building support

2. How to publicize the grant and project
